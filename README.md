# DodgeTheAsteroids-INSTALLER

This is the installer for DodgeTheAsteroids. I put it here in case anyone wants to download it.

When you download it, I recomend putting it in your DESKTOP first.

This is a .command file, which means it should just run when you double-click it. BUT you may need to allow for the file
to run on your device. If file doesn't run when you double clikc it, follow these instructions below.


=========================================================================================

Install this file, add it to your DESKTOP, and type in these commands from your terminal:

cd Desktop
chmod +x installer.command

This will allow installer.command to run as an executable
